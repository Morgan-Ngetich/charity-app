## Introduction
The project aims to replicate the core functionalities of Airbnb, allowing users to search for, book, and list properties for short-term rentals. It provides a user-friendly interface for property owners to manage their listings and for travelers to find and book accommodations.

## How the Project Works
The project utilizes a Flask backend to handle user authentication, property management, booking processing, review submissions, and notification delivery. The frontend is built with React to provide a responsive and intuitive user interface. The backend and front end communicate through RESTful API endpoints, enabling seamless interaction between the client and server.
